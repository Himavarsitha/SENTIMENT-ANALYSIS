Description:This project conducts sentiment analysis on McDonald’s customer reviews to understand public perception, identify pain points, and uncover improvement opportunities. The dataset includes textual feedback, ratings, timestamps, and metadata such as location or store ID, sourced from platforms like Google Reviews and social media. Data preprocessing involves cleaning, removing duplicates, and applying NLP techniques such as tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization. Emojis and slang are retained to capture nuanced emotions. Sentiment classification is performed using tools like VADER and machine learning models, including Logistic Regression and BERT. VADER efficiently handles context-sensitive text, while BERT detects sarcasm and complex phrases, improving sentiment detection accuracy. Reviews are categorized as positive, neutral, or negative, providing insights into customer experiences. Common complaints highlight long wait times, order errors, cleanliness concerns, and food quality, with seasonal trends emerging during peak hours. Positive reviews emphasize friendly staff, convenience, consistency, and specific menu items. Geographic variations in sentiment scores reveal regional differences, with urban stores facing speed complaints and rural stores receiving feedback on menu limitations. Insights are visualized through dashboards featuring word clouds, bar charts, and heatmaps. Word clouds of negative reviews highlight terms like "wait" and "cold food," while time-series plots reveal spikes in negative sentiment during lunch rushes. Heatmaps identify underperforming stores needing intervention. Actionable applications include operational improvements, such as training staff to reduce errors and optimizing workflows, and menu optimization by promoting highly praised items or reformulating criticized dishes. Customer engagement strategies involve using positive reviews in marketing and publicly addressing negative feedback. Competitive benchmarking compares sentiment scores against competitors to identify market strengths and weaknesses. Technical challenges such as sarcasm detection are addressed by fine-tuning models like BERT, while data imbalance is managed through oversampling and weighted loss functions. Scalability is achieved by deploying the analysis pipeline on cloud platforms for real-time processing. This sentiment analysis framework provides McDonald’s with structured insights to prioritize changes, improve service quality, and foster customer loyalty. It enables data-driven decision-making by transforming unstructured feedback into actionable insights. The methodology can be adapted to other restaurant chains or retail sectors, highlighting the universal value of sentiment analysis in enhancing customer experiences.
